### Project Scope
“Structural Transformation” is a theory in economic development that makes the following prediction: "as a country's economic activity shifts from agriculture, to manufacturing to the services sector, gdp per capita will rise".

If this holds true, then the **implications for developing country policy-makers** aiming to raise gdp per capita are significant - support policies that encourage a strcutural transformation of the economy away from low-productivity activites to higher-productivity activities. At a high level, some polices to achieve this may include: 

1. Investing in education by [supporting/creating STEM courses](https://www.millenniumpoint.org.uk/invest-in-stem/) and widening access to these through scholarship schemes.
2. Investing in basic technology infrastructure, such as [broadband, open sourced softwares and hardwares.](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/study-about-impact-open-source-software-and-hardware-technological-independence-competitiveness-and)
3. Creating [Business Enabling Environments (BEEs)](https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/pdf/BEE-Pre-Concept-Note---Feb-8-2022.pdf) to (1) attract foreign business and benefit from foreign technology transfers, and (2) promote local innovation clusters enabling development of local technology.

Of course, every country must identify and execute policies tailored to its own needs and goals. However, the value of a model describing the relationship between relative service sector size and gdp per capita may be of value to :

1. Policy makers responsible for managing fiscal and regulatory policies.
2. Researchers in the field of economic development.
3. Advocacy groups pressuring governments to invest for a country's future.
